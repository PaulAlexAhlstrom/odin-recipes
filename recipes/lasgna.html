            <li>2 eggs, beaten</li>
        </ul>
    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Preheat your oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C).</li>      
        <li>In a large skillet, cook the ground beef over medium heat until it is browned and crumbled. Add the diced onion and minced garlic to the skillet and cook until the onion is translucent. Stir in the crushed tomatoes, tomato paste, basil, salt, pepper, and water. Bring the mixture to a boil, then reduce the heat and simmer for 15 minutes.</li>
        <li>Meanwhile, bring a large pot of salted water to a boil and cook the lasagna noodles according to the package instructions. Drain the noodles and set them aside.</li>
        <li>In a medium bowl, mix together the ricotta cheese, Parmesan cheese, and beaten eggs.</li>
        <li>To assemble the lasagna, spread a thin layer of the meat sauce in the bottom of a 9x13-inch baking dish. Arrange 3 noodles over the sauce. Spread a layer of the cheese mixture over the noodles, then top with a layer of the meat sauce. Repeat the layers, ending with a layer of the meat sauce on top. Sprinkle the top with the mozzarella cheese.</li>
        <li>Bake the lasagna for 45 minutes, or until the cheese is melted and the lasagna is hot and bubbly. Let the lasagna cool for a few minutes before serving. Enjoy!</li>
